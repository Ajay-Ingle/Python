#1. Conditional Statements
#Control the flow based on conditions.
#Syntax:
"""
if condition:
    # Code block for true condition
elif another_condition:
    # Code block for elif
else:
    # Code block for false condition
"""

#2. Loops

#a. for Loop
#Used for iterating over a sequence.
#Syntax:
"""for item in sequence:
    # Code block for each iteration"""

#b. while Loop
#Repeats as long as the condition is true.
#Syntax:
"""while condition:
    # Code block for the loop
"""


#3. Loop Control Statements
#Modify the flow within loops.

#a. break
#Exits the loop immediately.
"""
for item in sequence:
    if condition:
        break

"""
#b. continue
#Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
"""
for item in sequence:
    if condition:
        continue

"""
#c. pass
#Does nothing; a placeholder.
#Syntax:
"""
for item in sequence:
    pass
